# SCNN lane detection Distributed Training

SCNN is a segmentation-tasked lane detection algorithm, described in ['Spatial As Deep: Spatial CNN for Traffic Scene Understanding'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06080). The [official implementation](<https://github.com/XingangPan/SCNN>).

This repository contains a re-implementation for performing distributed training using Horovod.
